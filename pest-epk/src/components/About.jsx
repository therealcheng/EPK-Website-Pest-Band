        The construction of the energetic unique sound amplified by this duo
        consists of Powerful Industrial drumming by Harvey Denman and Thunderous
        Nu-Metal riffs and Punk Rock vocal by Cameron Taylor. The PEST boys are
        actively performing shows around London and Hertfordshire with expansion
        out to the rest of the UK planned. This is displayed on their variety on
        social media platforms.
