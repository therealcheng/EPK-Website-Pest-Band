        The rebellion started as a Four-Piece in early 2020 but soon took flight
        as a Power Duo leading a new-wave punk rock battle. The PEST boys are
        actively performing shows around London and Hertfordshire with expansion
        out to the rest of the UK planned. This is displayed on their variety on
        social media platforms.
