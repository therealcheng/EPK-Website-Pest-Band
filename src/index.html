            PEST is a Punk Rock Two-Piece movement based in Hertfordshire.
          </h1>
          <p class="hero-p">
            The construction of the energetic unique sound amplified by this duo
            consists of Powerful Industrial drumming by Harvey Denman and
            Thunderous Nu-Metal riffs and Punk Rock vocal by Cameron Taylor. The
            rebellion started as a Four-Piece in early 2020 but soon took flight
            as a Power Duo leading a new-wave punk rock battle.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-p">
            The PEST boys are actively performing shows around London and
            Hertfordshire with expansion out to the rest of the UK planned. This
            is displayed on their variety on social media platforms.
          </p>
