# Introduction

Electronic press kit (custom-portfolio) for two piece punk-rock band Pest.

An Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is a resume or CV for music artists. Itâ€™s designed to provide labels, agents, music supervisors, venue talent, buyers and the media with essential information to understand who you are as an artist so that you can get noticed, land a gig and/or make connections.
