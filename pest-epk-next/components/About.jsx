        PEST is an Industrial Nu-Punk Two-Piece movement from the UK. The
        energetic unique sound amplified by this duo consists of Powerful
        Industrial drumming by Harvey Denman and Thunderous Nu-Metal riffs and
        Punk Rock vocals by Cameron Taylor. The rebellion started in early 2020
        and took flight in London as a Power Duo leading a new-wave punk rock
        battle.
