        PEST, a two-person punk rock band, was formed in Hertfordshire, a county
        in southern England, in early 2020. The band's name is an acronym for
        "Powerful Electric Shock Therapy," a name that reflects their energetic
        and rebellious approach to music. The band consists of two talented
        musicians, Harvey Denman and Cameron Taylor, who have been playing music
        together for several years.

        The duo's music can be described as a unique blend of Punk and
        Industrial Nu-Metal genres. Harvey's powerful and dynamic drumming,
        combined with Cameron's thunderous guitar riffs and punk rock vocals,
        creates a sound that is both powerful and captivating. Their energetic
        performances are a true reflection of the DIY punk rock ethos, and they
        have quickly established themselves as one of the most exciting
        up-and-coming bands in the UK music scene.

        In early 2020, PEST started to gain a following, performing at local
        venues in Hertfordshire and the surrounding areas. However, it wasn't
        long before their music caught the attention of the wider music
        community in London. The duo's power-packed performances and their
        unique sound soon led to them being recognized as a Power Duo leading a
        new-wave punk rock battle.

      <p className=' text-white text-md mt-4 lg:text-white px-10 lg:text-lg'>
        Since then, PEST has continued to make waves in the UK music scene.
        Their music has been well-received by both fans and critics, and they
        have been featured in various music publications and online platforms.
        With their raw energy and unique style, PEST is a band to watch out for
        in the coming years.
